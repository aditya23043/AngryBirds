# ANGRY BIRDS GAME DEVELOPMENT LOG

> Note: I started this dev log after figuring out gradle, gdx-liftoff, and how to add skins in libgdx\
> Note2: All my source code for the 2nd submission is in the `src/` directory

## Skin
- Added the shade ui skin from https://github.com/czyzby/gdx-skins to my `src/assets/skins/shade`
